    "This project involves using the diameter of a common tree species in Vancouver, used to compare different streets. These streets are where some of us as group members reside, so we were interested in determining what would be the diameter of this common tree species which is very populated here in Vancouver, BC.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background Information\n",
    "\n",
    "The diameter of a tree’s trunk reveals the growth of a tree and is closely relative to the surrounding environment. Trees need water, sunlight and carbon dioxide to produce nutrients for themselves so that they can use the chemical energy to grow in height and girth(diameter). The growth of the trunk's diameter usually happens after the primary growth; for a tree, primary growth is responsible for the height of the tree and the depth of its root (Cavallo-Medve, et al., 1971). After the primary growth or in the meanwhile, the secondary growth takes place. The secondary growth will develop in the width (diameter) of a tree’s trunk. In this research, we are comparing the same kind of tree (Magnolia) on different streets, aiming to observe whether there exists a potential environmental influence on the trees. According to Berlyn (2022), “Tree height is closely associated with the quality of the site on which the tree is growing (i.e., the climate, soil topography, and biota), radial growth is tied more to the weather conditions of the current year.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "This report can be used by city officials to determine if there are reasons that affect tree growth based on its diameter. From the data, we can see if there are ways to make tree growth more consistent (determining if there is enough care being taken to keep the environment green, etc...); however, our plot and estimates are not enough to give to stakeholders, as it's important that we must gather more data, perhaps comparing other streets in Vancouver or using different variables such as neighbourhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Our Inferential Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "For our inferential research question, our group decided to focus on the following question: \"Do the Magnolia trees on Charles street differ in diameter from the diameters of the Magnolia trees on Churchill street? We plan on collecting data from the City of Vancouver Open Data Portal, where we're focusing on the variables of GENUS_NAME, DIAMETER, and STD_STREET. In addition, we plan on having  our population of interest be Magnolia trees on Charles St. and Churchill St (these are streets that some of our group members reside on). For our point estimate, we are doing the mean difference between Magnolia trees’ diameters on Charles St. and Churchill St. For our hypothesis, we have...\n",

    "In this project, we use two methods to discover whether there is a difference in tree diameters between two streets. The first method is both a simulation based and theory based hypothesis test to determine if the sample means of the two groups are the same. To perform the hypothesis test, we filter our sample into two groups, one of Magnolia trees on Charles St., and one of the same on Churchill St. These two populations are independent, even though the trees are the same species.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will graph a boxplot to get an idea of the shape of our data. Here, we can immediate see that the two samples have different means. We compute the means of the two populations and can see a difference of $12.338710 - 3.744792 = 8.593918$. At least in our sample, the two streets have completely different means and show that Charles St. has many thick trees compared to thinner trees on Churchill St. In summary, this initial step indicates that the diameters of Magnolia trees on Charles St. differ from those planted on Churchill St. However, the above steps only provide us with an estimate applicable to only our sample. To answer our research question, \"Do the Magnolia trees on Charles St. differ in diameter from the Magnolia trees on Churchill St.?”, we need to conduct a hypothesis test.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an independant two-sample hypothesis test. We will go about testing the hypothesis using both a simulation and a t-test. The t-test is applicable here as the entire population of trees should follow a normal distribution, and each of our samples have size greater than 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis** ($H_0$): The mean diameter of Magnolia trees is the same on Charles St. and Churchill St.\n",

    "Then, we can calculate the p-value for this hypothesis test. Here, we use the t.test() to produce a p-value. Since the p-value is less than 0.05, we can conclude that by a 5% significance level, we are willing to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a difference in the trees’ diameter when planted on different streets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, we construct a bootstrap sampling distribution to estimate the differences in the means of trees’ diameter between two streets (x1-x2). Through using bootstrap with 10,000 replicates, we obtain a 95% confidence interval: from 7.155102 into 10.08364 in. This result demonstrates that we are 95% confident that the true (population) mean differences in trees’ diameter between two streets will be somewhere between 7.155102 in and 10.08364 in. More importantly, this interval does not include 0, which implies that the differences in the means between two streets will not equal zero. "

    "According to the above results, we can conclude that the trees’ diameter will be affected when planting in different streets ($H_a$). We think the hypothesis test is more appropriate than the bootstrapping since bootstrapping is not as robust as the t-distribution under the CLT assumption. Furthermore, the conditions for using bootstrapping are less strict than the hypothesis test (t-test); thus, the hypothesis test is more trustworthy than the bootstrap method.  However, bootstrapping is useful to provide a rough overview of the sampling distribution and convincing support for the hypothesis test. In conclusion, the results of the two methods meet our expectations: the Magnolia trees on Charles Street differ in diameter from the diameters of the Magnolia trees on Churchill Street. Therefore, it can lead to a future research question to find out the possible factors related to this difference. For example, the environment that the two streets possess, the number of years since these trees have been planted and so on.\n",
